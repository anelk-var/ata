[Meeting of 10 Jan 2015]
Groups so far.
1[EM]. Gourav (entity modeling , ex. tourist places)
2[RC]. Sonali+Rohit (review categorization/email sorting)
3[IO]. Aditya (information outbreak in networks)
4[IS]. Sarthak (news articles and investor sentiments)

Dist. repr. from words to sentences:
Must read:
1. Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality by Tomas Mikolov and others. Code available.

2. Semisupervised recursive autoencoders for predicting sentiment distributions by Socher and others.

3. Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents by Quoc and Mikolov.

4. Evaluation of Simple Distributional Compositional Operationson Longer Texts by Tamara Polajnar and others.

5. Combined Distributional and Logical Semantics by Mike Lewis and Mark Steedman.

Refs. 1, 2 and 3 are about distributional representations which are of immediate necessity. This should then be followed up with extensions from 4 and 5 to complete the feature representation of textual blocks (sentences, paragraphs or tweets- tweets might need some spelling correction when necessary).

Additional readings (on logical representations):
1. Erk, K. (2013). Towards a semantics for distributional representations. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS2013).

2. Garrette, D., Erk, K., and Mooney, R. (2014). A formal approach to linking logical form and vector-space lexical semantics. In Bunt, H., Bos, J., and Pulman, S., editors. Text, Speech and Language Technology: Computing Meaning, 47:27-48. Springer.

3. Turney, P. D. and Pantel, P. (2010). From frequency to meaning: Vector space models of semantics. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 37:141-188.

Specific readings:
1[IS]. Reading the Markets: Forecasting Public Opinion of Political Candidates by News Analysis by Kevin Lerman and others.

2[IS].  Semantic Frames to Predict Stock Price Movement by Boyi Xie and others.

3[IO]. Learning Evolving and Emerging Topics in Social Media: A Dynamic NMF approach with Temporal Regularization by Ankan Saha and Vikas Sindhwani.

4[IO]. Emerging topic detection on Twitter based on temporal and social terms evaluation by Matio Cataldi and others.

5[IO]. Earthquake Shakes Twitter Users: Real-time Event Detection by Social Sensors by Takeshi Sakaki, Makoto Okazaki and Yutaka Matsuo.


Unsupervised methods for clustering of training data (finite/infinite):
[Mixture models/K-means with varying K in batch case]
[Topic models/Dictionary learning/Matrix factorization]
[Chinese restaurant/Indian buffet]

Semi-supervised learning:
Posterior regularization +
human in the loop correction +
active learning-
to correct for categories, representation or weights linking them.

Applications to:
Entity modeling with dist. repr.
Review/email categorization
Trends and outbreaks in streams
Textual effects of forecasting
