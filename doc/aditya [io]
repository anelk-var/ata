Progress during the weeks (17 jan to 7 feb)

problem in finding the twitter dataset. Twitter datasets are removed once they are made public.
Most twitter databases i came accross were csv files.
I emailed the stanford snap lab for database and a korean group but got no response till now.
Configured the scikit library.
From the paper: Earthquake Shakes Twitter Users: Real-time Event Detection by Social Sensors, I learnt :
                                                  1.Sementic analysis to classify tweets into positive and negative tweets
                                                  2.Applying kalman and particle filters to detect the location of the event
                                                  3.Applying probabilistic models to detect an event in real time.
Read another inmportant paper about information outbreak on twitter: Learning Evolving and Emerging Topics in Social Media: A Dynamic NMF approach with Temporal Regularization
                                                  1. This paper categorises the topics as evolving and emerging topics
                                                  2. This paper is a mathematically rigourous in its approach to deal with the topics evolving and emerging.
                                                  3. This paper can serve as the base approach to do any further work in this project.
Read other must read papers mentioned in the roadmap doc.



Future Plans:
To start implementing working model for information outbreak as soon as possible so as to study the information outbreak during world cup
Develop my own mathematical models or improvise some existing ones to track the emergence of topics.
