1.we have installed scikit

3.extracting features from text files
4.training a classifier
5. predicting the category of the new document
we have written a python code for all these things to happen.

future plans
------------
1.We think this is just the basic running version, it needs to be configured in a better way
2.till now , we have done all this over supervised data , next we will try to do this over unsupervised data using (k-mean clustering algorithm ) or may be another algorithm.
