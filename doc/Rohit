1.we have installed scikit
2.we have downloaded the data
3.extracting features from text files
4.training a classifier
5. predicting the category of the new document
we have written a python code for all these things to happen.

future plans
------------
1.We think this is just the basic running version, it needs to be configured in a better way
2.till now , we have done all this over supervised data , next we will try to do this over unsupervised data using (k-mean clustering algorithm ) or may be another algorithm.

1.Model Persistence is done
(the model is saved in a file using python pickle library)

date[16:02:2015]
1. comparision of different classifier on the basis of their prediction accuracy , time taken to train and test , f1-score and dimensionality
on the basis of which we can decide which classifier is suitable for our model
2. code file code.py is uploaded in src folder
